Statistical Analysis and Visualization Projects

Project 1: This project investigates the growth patterns of trout from Harrison Lake by analyzing the relationship between fish age and fork length. It features visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and regression analysis to uncover trends in fish population data.

Project 2: This project analyzes the frequency of various fish species and visualizes the results through Pareto and bar charts. The analysis helps identify the most prevalent species and highlights cumulative patterns within the dataset.
